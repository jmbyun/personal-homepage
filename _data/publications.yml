    abstract: "We propose Pythonpad, an open-source JavaScript library that supports web-based Python programming exercises. Unlike other standalone web-based programming tools, Pythonpad can be easily integrated into other websites. Although it runs learners' Python code in client-side web browsers, Pythonpad supports file system, building and importing external modules, and many essential built-in Python libraries to teach basic programming concepts in CS1 classes."

    abstract: "In online programming classes, it is tricky to uphold academic honesty in the assessment process. A common approach, plagiarism detection, is not accurate for novice programmers and ineffective for detecting contract cheaters. We present a new approach, cheating detection with keystroke dynamics in programming classes, and evaluated the approach."

    abstract: "In this work, we present Cocode, an online learning system where learners can share their presence without any explicit action; their normal learning activities would signal co-learner presence. Cocode is a web application for online programming courses that shows other learners' code editors and running screens in the programming environment to the learners while working on exercises. Evaluation results show that Cocode makes learners work on more hands-on exercises."

    abstract: "In this paper, we improve distributed word representations for Korean language by decomposing words into the consonants and vowels to use the subword information. To evaluate the vectors, we develop Korean test sets for word similarity and analogy and make them publicly available. The results show that our simple method outperforms word2vec and character-level Skip-Grams on semantic and syntactic similarity."

    abstract: "We study multilingualism by collecting and analyzing a large dataset of the content written by multilingual editors of the English, German, and Spanish editions of Wikipedia. We analyze these multilingual editors in terms of their engagement, interests, and language proficiency in their primary and non-primary (secondary) languages and find that the English edition of Wikipedia displays different dynamics from the Spanish and German editions. Users primarily editing the Spanish and German editions make more complex edits than users who edit these editions as a second language. In contrast, users editing the English edition as a second language make edits that are just as complex as the edits by users who primarily edit the English edition. In this way, English serves a special role bringing together content written by multilinguals from many language editions. ..."

    abstract: "For many people who speak more than one language, their language proficiency for each of the languages varies. We identify Wikipedia as a great resource for studying multilingualism, and we conduct a quantitative analysis of the language complexity of primary and non-primary users of English, German, and Spanish. Our preliminary results indicate that there are indeed consistent differences of language complexity in the Wikipedia articles chosen by primary and non-primary users, as well as differences in the edits by the two groups of users."
